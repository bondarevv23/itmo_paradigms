# itmo_paradigms

This repository contains the homeworks solution of the course "Ð—rogramming paradigms" of the second semester of ITMO University.

### Java solutions
1. [expression](java-solutions/expression): error handling in the expression parser + expression evaluation in different types using generic
2. [search](java-solutions/search): binary search with a full description of the contract: pre and post conditions. proof of compliance with the contract in terms of Hoare triples
3. [queue](java-solutions/queue): 3 implementation of a queue on an array with a full description of the contract. queue on linked list

### Java Script
1. [functional expression](javascript-solutions/functionalExpression.js): set of functions for representing and evaluating expressions with three variables
2. [object expression](javascript-solutions/objectExpression.js): classes for representing and evaluating expressions with three variables. parser for prefix representation of expressions and error handling during parsing of expressions

### Clojure
1. [linear algebra](clojure-solutions/linear.clj): 
functions for working with linear algebra objects: scalars, vectors, matrices. each function contains a contract of pre and post conditions
2. [expression](clojure-solutions/expression.clj): functional and object expressions. expression parser of the standard clojure form into the object model, each of the functions can take an arbitrary number of arguments
3. [parser](clojure-solutions/parser.clj): combinatorial parser for infix expressions using the combinator library

### Prolog
1. [primes](prolog-solutions/primes.pl) rules for determining whether a number is prime using the sieve of Eratosthenes
2. [tree-map](prolog-solutions/tree-map.pl) associative array based on Cartesian search tree
